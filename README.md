VG2-Bayes

Bayesian analysis of key VVG studies

This manuscript and R code inspects violent video game studies which have tried to argue the truth of the
null hypothesis on the basis of p > .05.

Bad_Pilots.R inspects the evidence for the null hypothesis of matched stimuli in some small-n pilot tests.
Bayes_Factors_for_MS2.R re-analyzes the studies' main findings with regard to two hypotheses:
  HA1: There is a nonspecific effect, as described by a JZS prior.
  HA2: There is a specific effect as predicted by Anderson et al., 2010.
