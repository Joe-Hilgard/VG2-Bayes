# Glider Pro & Marathon 2 might be equivalent on difficulty, enjoyment, frustration, but might differ in pace of action
# Experiments 2 and 3 of this manuscript have larger sample sizes and use similar manipulations.
#   Experiment 2 does not report any check of these matching variables.
#   Experiment 3 reports an absence of statistical significance, but the manipulation is a little different,
#     and the necessary summary statistics are not reported.
